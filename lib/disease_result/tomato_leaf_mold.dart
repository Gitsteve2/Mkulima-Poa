It is important to alternate between different chemical families to avoid the development of pathogen resistance to particular active ingredients.For organic growers, trials in New York have shown the copper-based product Champ gave some level of control.  When using copper hydroxide for tomato leaf mold, make sure the product is labeled for organic use.  Formulations with higher percentages of copper will be more effective but have an increased re-entry interval (REI / the amount of time you must wait between applying and re-entering the area for safety reasons).",
